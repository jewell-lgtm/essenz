# Open Questions

Before continuing development, we should answer these key questions to guide our direction and decisions.

## üéØ Core Product Questions

- [ ] **What should `sz` actually do?**
  - Should we implement the web scraping/markdown conversion described in the README?
  - Or keep it as a simple toy app and add different features?
  - What's the minimum viable functionality for our first real feature?

- [ ] **What's our target user?**
  - Developers who want to extract web content to markdown?
  - CLI enthusiasts learning Go?
  - People who need readable versions of web articles?

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Questions

- [ ] **Project structure - how should we organize the code?**
  - Should we follow the layout described in README (`internal/browser/`, `internal/extractor/`, etc.)?
  - Or start simpler with just `cmd/` and `pkg/`?
  - Do we need the full proposed architecture for a learning project?

- [ ] **What external dependencies do we want?**
  - The go.mod mentions chromedp, go-readability, cobra - do we use these?
  - Should we minimize dependencies to focus on Go fundamentals?
  - Are we building a "real" tool or a learning exercise?

- [ ] **Configuration approach?**
  - Should we implement the YAML config mentioned in README?
  - Environment variables? Command flags only?
  - How complex should our configuration be?

## üß™ Testing & Quality Questions

- [ ] **Testing strategy depth?**
  - Are the current unit tests + executable specs sufficient?
  - Do we need integration tests with real web scraping?
  - Should we mock external dependencies or test against real sites?

- [ ] **Error handling patterns?**
  - What Go error handling patterns should we establish?
  - How should we handle network failures, parsing errors, etc.?
  - Should we use structured logging (logrus, zap) or keep it simple?

## üöÄ Development & Deployment Questions

- [ ] **Release strategy?**
  - Should we set up automated releases with GitHub Actions?
  - Do we need cross-platform builds (Windows, Linux, macOS)?
  - Should we publish to package managers (Homebrew, etc.)?

- [ ] **Documentation completeness?**
  - The README has extensive docs for features we don't have - update or implement?
  - Should we focus on godoc comments and keep README minimal?
  - Do we need contributor guidelines beyond what's there?

## üéì Learning & Scope Questions

- [ ] **What Go concepts should we prioritize learning?**
  - Interfaces and composition?
  - Goroutines and concurrency?
  - HTTP clients and web scraping?
  - File I/O and data processing?

- [ ] **Feature scope for next iteration?**
  - Should our next commit add a real feature (like fetching a URL)?
  - Or focus on improving the development experience (CI/CD, more tooling)?
  - What's the smallest meaningful feature we could add?

- [ ] **Performance and optimization?**
  - Should we worry about performance from the start?
  - Are there specific Go performance patterns we should learn?
  - Should we add benchmarking and profiling?

## ü§ù Collaboration Questions

- [ ] **How do you prefer to learn/work?**
  - Do you want to implement features yourself with guidance?
  - Should I implement things and explain the decisions?
  - Do you prefer small incremental steps or larger feature additions?

- [ ] **What's your comfort level with complexity?**
  - Are you ready for more advanced Go concepts?
  - Should we stick to basics for now?
  - How much external library usage vs. building from scratch?

## üö¶ Recommended Starting Points

**High Priority** - Answer these first:

- [ ] **Feature scope for next iteration** - What's the next smallest meaningful feature?
- [ ] **How do you prefer to learn/work** - Approach to development and learning
- [ ] **What should `sz` actually do** - Should we build toward the README vision or pivot?

These will guide all our other decisions and help us maintain momentum with focused, conventional commits!
