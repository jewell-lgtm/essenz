You are tasked with writing out a full spec, feature by feature for a product called essenz.

Here is some initial discussion on the matter, for you to refer to: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cd2a2a-d6e8-8012-95d0-7da6cc4619b5

By the time you are finished and the spec is completed, there should be a github repo (public and open source, with license), which a naive user could view the readme and start using the app, or contribute to the project, just by reading the readme. There should be comprehensive integration and unit tests (but dont focus on 100% test coverage or anything dumb like that)

I want to use bubble tea.

The ONLY output you should be creating right now is markdown files (specs and readme), and a high level implementation guide.
