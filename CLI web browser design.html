Report conversation


          You said:

I was thinking about making a CLI web browser. The idea is to reorder the text, so it is arranged in importance order, rather than the order it is in the source code. How might I go about the initial grok of the html, and deciding how to reorder the text nodes to make a markdown version of the page 


            ChatGPT said:

That‚Äôs a very cool idea ‚Äî essentially building a *semantic-first CLI
browser* that flattens a web page into a linear Markdown-like document,
with the /most important content first/, stripping away clutter like
navbars, ads, and sidebars.

Let‚Äôs break down the challenge and how you might approach it:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üß† Step 1 ‚Äî Parsing and Building a Semantic Model

Goal: Grok the HTML structure and build an internal content model you
can analyze.

*How:*

  *

    Use an HTML parser (e.g. |BeautifulSoup| in Python, |parse5| or |
    jsdom| in Node, |goquery| in Go, etc.).

  *

    Extract all text nodes with their enclosing elements and build a DOM
    tree.

*Record metadata* for each text node:

  *

    Tag name (h1, p, li, etc.)

  *

    Position in the DOM

  *

    Attributes (role, aria, class/id names)

  *

    Size (number of characters, children count)

  *

    Visual hierarchy hints (|<header>|, |<main>|, |<footer>|, |<aside>|)

This gives you a structured representation of all textual content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üß† Step 2 ‚Äî Scoring Importance

Goal: Assign a "content importance" score to each block of text.

Think of this like a mini search engine‚Äôs "boilerplate removal" problem
(like Readability

or Goose

).

*Features to consider for importance scoring:*

  *

    *Tag weight:*

      o

        |<title>|, |<h1>| ‚Üí very high

      o

        |<h2>|, |<h3>| ‚Üí high

      o

        |<p>|, |<li>| ‚Üí medium

      o

        |<nav>|, |<aside>|, |<footer>| ‚Üí low

  *

    *Location in the tree:*

      o

        Large blocks inside |<main>| or |<article>| likely primary content

      o

        Repeated blocks (same class repeated many times across pages)
        likely boilerplate

  *

    *Text length:*

      o

        Longer coherent text blocks get higher weight than short nav-
        like items

  *

    *Link density:*

      o

        Blocks with mostly links are usually navigation, not content

  *

    *Semantic roles:*

      o

        |role="main"| or |role="article"| ‚Üí high

  *

    *Heuristics from readability algorithms:*

      o

        Mozilla‚Äôs Readability library has proven heuristics for
        identifying main content

You can combine these with a simple weighted formula or even train a
small ML classifier later on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üß† Step 3 ‚Äî Building the Ordered Markdown

Goal: Output a clean Markdown doc in order of descending importance.

*Process:*

 1.

    Sort content blocks by importance score.

 2.

    Convert tags to Markdown syntax:

      *

        |<h1>| ‚Üí |# Heading|

      *

        |<h2>| ‚Üí |## Subheading|

      *

        |<p>| ‚Üí plain paragraph

      *

        |<ul><li>| ‚Üí |- list item|

      *

        |<a href>| ‚Üí |[text](url)|

 3.

    Concatenate blocks into a linear stream of text.

This gives you something like:

md

Copy code

|# Article Title

## Section One
Some important text content...

## Section Two
More text content...

* [Source link](https://example.com)
|

Optionally, you could also:

  *

    Include images with alt text if they‚Äôre inside high-scoring content
    blocks

  *

    Include metadata (author, date, canonical URL)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üß† Step 4 ‚Äî CLI UX

  *

    Input: |cli-browser https://example.com|

  *

    Output: prints Markdown to stdout (pipeable to |less|)

  *

    Add flags like |--top 5| to only show top 5 content blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚ö° Tools and Libraries to Look At

  *

    *Readability algorithms:*

      o

        mozilla/readability

        (JS)

      o

        go-readability

        (Go)

      o

        python-readability-lxml

  *

    *HTML parsing:*

      o

        Python: |BeautifulSoup|

      o

        Go: |goquery|

      o

        Node: |jsdom|, |cheerio|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üß† Possible Enhancements Later

  *

    Use LLM or summarization to further condense content

  *

    Keep a side-channel of extracted links for exploration

  *

    Add TUI navigation (browse links, go back)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can *sketch out a concrete algorithm* (pseudo-code) for
the "importance scoring + markdown output" part ‚Äî the heart of your CLI
browser.

Would you like me to do that next?


          You said:

I think the idea of using an existing "reader mode" sounds good. But I'd like to use some additional heuristics to pull out the "gist" of a page


            ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great instinct.

Using a *reader-mode extractor (like Mozilla Readability)* will get you
*90% of the way there*: it strips away navigation, ads, and boilerplate,
leaving the article-like main content.

Then, on top of that, you can layer your own *"gist-finding heuristics"*
to rearrange and highlight the /key points/ ‚Äî not just raw text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äî Extract the main content

Use a Readability-like library for your language:

  *

    *Go:* |go-readability|

  *

    *Python:* |readability-lxml|

  *

    *Node/JS:* |mozilla/readability|

This gives you:

  *

    |title|

  *

    |byline|

  *

    |content| (HTML of the main article body)

You can then parse |content| into a DOM fragment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2 ‚Äî Segment content blocks

Split the article content into logical blocks:

  *

    Headings (|h1..h3|)

  *

    Paragraphs

  *

    Lists

  *

    Figures (image + caption)

  *

    Blockquotes

Keep them as a linear sequence of |{tag, text, length, linkDensity,
headingLevel}| objects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3 ‚Äî Score blocks for "gist" relevance

Here you‚Äôre trying to surface *what matters the most*, not just the
order it appears. Some heuristics:

Heuristic	Signal
*Heading level*	High weight for |h1|, medium for |h2|, low for |h3+|
*First paragraph*	Usually an intro ‚Üí high weight
*Text length*	Medium length (50‚Äì300 words) often the "meat"
*Position in article*	Early content is often more important
*Keyword density*	Repeated keywords hint at main topic
*Highlighty tags*	|<strong>|, |<em>|, |<blockquote>| bump weight
*Link density*	Too many links = probably nav-like or tangential

A quick weighted formula could be:

text

Copy code

|score = headingBonus + lengthScore + (1 - linkDensity) + positionBonus + highlightBonus
|

Then sort by score descending.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4 ‚Äî Build your Markdown gist

From your scored blocks:

  *

    Output top N blocks

  *

    Convert tags to Markdown (|#|, |##|, |>|, |-|)

  *

    Optionally prepend a short "summary" (first paragraph or generated one)

Example:

md

Copy code

|# How Bees Build Hives

**By Jane Smith**

> Bees are nature's master builders.

## Hive Structure
Bees construct hexagonal cells from wax...

## Communication
They use a "waggle dance"...
|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5 ‚Äî Optional: Add light summarization

Once you have extracted blocks, you can:

  *

    Collapse each into 1‚Äì2 sentences using a frequency-based keyword
    summarizer (like |sumy|) or an LLM

  *

    Output a concise bullet list at the top

This would give the user a /TL;DR/ immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can draft a *concrete scoring algorithm in pseudocode*
you could drop into your CLI as a first pass.

Would you like me to do that next? (It would make this go from concept
to something you can build quickly.)


          You said:

let's do the whole thing in Go, but instead of writing code write a comprehensive spec. We want to do as much as we can *without* using an LLM, extracting the content as markdown, with some frontmatter type meta info (including navigation links) at the end. The output should be a code block of markdown that I can copy and paste into another tool 


            ChatGPT said:

Copy code

|# CLI Semantic Browser ‚Äî Go Implementation SPEC (no LLM)
> Comprehensive design spec for a Go-based CLI web browser that extracts page content into **importance-ordered Markdown**, adds light heuristic summarization (no LLM), and appends a frontmatter-style metadata block **at the end** (including navigation / links).

---

## 1. Goals & constraints
- Produce a single Markdown document (stdout or file) representing a web page, with the most *important* content first.
- Do **not** use an LLM. All heuristics and summarization must be deterministic, rule- or statistic-based.
- Use stable Go libraries for HTML parsing and "reader mode" extraction where possible.
- Output Markdown + a final frontmatter-like metadata block (YAML-style or TOML-like) **at the end** that includes navigation links and meta info.
- Make the tool pipe-friendly (prints to stdout) and usable inside scripts / pagers.

---

## 2. High-level pipeline
1. **Fetch** URL (HTTP client with sane defaults).
2. **Canonicalization & HTML normalization** (fix encodings, remove script/style).
3. **Reader-mode extraction** (use `go-readability` or fallback heuristics).
4. **DOM parsing & block segmentation** (use `goquery` to create a sequence of blocks).
5. **Per-block feature extraction** (tag type, char length, link density, emphasis, position).
6. **Scoring** each block with a deterministic weighted function.
7. **Post-process**: merge/split adjacent blocks, deduplicate, deduce headings.
8. **Optional summarization** of each top block via statistical sentence scoring.
9. **Convert to Markdown** (headings, lists, links, images).
10. **Assemble final Markdown** in descending importance order.
11. **Append frontmatter/meta block** (YAML/TOML) with navigation links and metadata.

---

## 3. Dependencies (recommended)
- `net/http` (standard) ‚Äî fetching.
- `golang.org/x/net/html` ‚Äî low-level HTML parse (used by goquery).
- `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` ‚Äî DOM traversal & selection.
- `github.com/go-shiori/go-readability` ‚Äî optional: main-content extraction (article HTML, title, byline). If unavailable, fallback to internal heuristics similar to Readability.
- `github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday` ‚Äî HTML sanitization (optional).
- `github.com/russross/blackfriday/v2` or custom converter ‚Äî but we will implement a small HTML-to-Markdown renderer for the subset we need (headings, p, ul/ol, a, img, blockquote, code) ‚Äî **avoid heavy dependencies**.

> Note: Prefer minimal third-party libs; `go-readability` is recommended for robust reader mode.

---

## 4. Data models
```go
// conceptual definitions (for the spec)
type Block struct {
  ID string             // unique id (e.g., DOM path)
  Tag string            // e.g., "p", "h2", "li", "blockquote", "figure"
  Text string           // textual content (trimmed)
  HTML string           // raw inner HTML (sanitized)
  WordCount int
  CharCount int
  LinkCount int
  LinkDensity float64   // LinkCount / WordCount (or CharCount)
  EmphasisScore float64 // counts of <strong>/<em>/<b>/<i> normalized
  HeadingLevel int      // 1..6 or 0 for none
  Position int          // index within article sequence (0 based)
  NodeDepth int         // depth in DOM within article fragment
  RepeatedClassScore float64 // heuristic for template content
  Score float64         // combined importance score
  Sentences []string    // tokenized sentences (for summarizer)
  ExtractedLinks []string
}
|

Also:

  *

    |PageMeta| containing Title, Byline, Canonical, URL, PublishedTime,
    TopNavLinks, AllLinks, CrawlTimestamp, Language (if detected).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    5. Fetching & normalization

  *

    Use |net/http.Client| with:

      o

        Timeout (10s default).

      o

        Follow redirects up to N (e.g., 10).

      o

        Reasonable headers: |User-Agent: cli-browser/0.1 (+https://
        example)|; accept gzip.

  *

    On fetch:

      o

        Respect |robots.txt|? (config flag; default: ignore for quick
        dev, configurable).

      o

        Save final URL after redirects.

      o

        Detect content-type; if non-HTML (PDF, image) bail with a
        helpful message.

  *

    Normalize HTML into UTF-8; strip |<script>|, |<style>|, and hidden
    nodes (|display:none| from inline style) before analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    6. Reader-mode extraction

  *

    Preferred: call |go-readability|'s |Parse(url, body)| ‚Üí returns
    title, byline, content (fragment HTML) and main image, length.

  *

    Fallback: implement a lightweight Readability-like heuristic:

      o

        Score element blocks by tag and text length, penalize high link
        density, boost |<article>| / |role="main"|, aggregate the best
        subtree.

  *

    The output of this stage should be a compact HTML fragment
    representing the /article/ or main content. If |readability| fails,
    the tool should still continue using full-page DOM, but with heavier
    penalties for header/footer/aside.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    7. Block segmentation

  *

    Parse the article fragment into a linear sequence of blocks via DOM
    traversal:

      o

        Treat |h1..h4|, |p|, |li|, |blockquote|, |figure|, |pre|, |
        table| as block candidates.

      o

        Flatten nested inline tags.

      o

        Keep order /as found/ for segmentation but do not commit to
        final order yet.

  *

    For each block:

      o

        Compute |WordCount|, |CharCount|, |LinkCount| and |LinkDensity|.

      o

        Compute |HeadingLevel| from tag.

      o

        Extract sentences (simple rule: split on |.?!| plus guard
        against numeric decimals).

      o

        Count emphasis tags (|strong|, |b|, |em|, |i|).

      o

        Capture images & alt text when present; treat |figure| captions
        as high-value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    8. Feature engineering (per block)

Compute features used by scoring:

  *

    |tagWeight|:

      o

        title / h1 ‚Üí 3.0

      o

        h2 ‚Üí 2.0

      o

        h3 ‚Üí 1.2

      o

        p, li ‚Üí 1.0

      o

        blockquote ‚Üí 1.4

      o

        pre/code ‚Üí 1.5

      o

        small/aside/nav/footer ‚Üí 0.2

  *

    |lengthScore|:

      o

        Use a smooth function: |lengthScore = tanh( log(wordCount + 1) /
        C )| where |C| tuned to make 0..1 range; or piecewise:

          +

            0-10 words ‚Üí 0.1

          +

            10-50 ‚Üí 0.6

          +

            50-400 ‚Üí 1.0 (sweet spot)

          +

                400 ‚Üí 0.9 (long but still good)

  *

    |positionBonus|:

      o

        Early blocks get slight boost: |positionBonus = 1 - (position /
        totalBlocks) * posFactor| (posFactor ~0.5)

  *

    |linkPenalty|:

      o

        |linkPenalty = clamp(linkDensity * 2, 0, 1)| subtract from score

  *

    |emphasisBonus|:

      o

        |emphasisBonus = min(0.5, emphasisCount * 0.1)|

  *

    |repeatedClassPenalty|:

      o

        If block class appears many times in page and has small text ‚Üí
        likely boilerplate; compute |repeatedClassScore| as |1 /
        occurrences| and boost small values into penalty.

  *

    |nodeDepthBonus|:

      o

        Shallow nodes under |<article>| get boost; very deep nodes
        penalized slightly.

Combine into final score:

ini

Copy code

|score_raw = tagWeight * (0.6*lengthScore + 0.3*emphasisBonus + 0.1*headingBonus)
score = score_raw * (1 + positionBonus) * (1 - linkPenalty) * repeatedClassScoreAdjustment
|

Tuning: Provide default weights in config file and expose as CLI flags
for experimentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    9. Deduplication & merging heuristic

  *

    Merge adjacent |<p>| blocks if there is no heading between them and
    combined text remains coherent (e.g., no list / figure).

  *

    Detect duplicated text (near exact match) and keep the longest
    occurrence with highest score.

  *

    Collapse short nav-like lists (many |a| links with low words) into a
    single summarized link list rather than including all as main content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    10. Summarizer (statistical, per-block)

Goal: produce short (1‚Äì3 sentence) gist for each top block w/o LLM.

Method (Sentence Ranking):

 1.

    Tokenize sentences in the block.

 2.

    Build frequency map of words in the block after stopword removal and
    stemming (porter stemmer optional).

 3.

    Score each sentence: sum of word frequencies normalized by sentence
    length + boost for sentences containing heading words.

 4.

    Optionally penalize sentences with too many links.

 5.

    Pick top N sentences (1‚Äì2) as the sentence-summary for the block.

 6.

    For the overall page TL;DR, choose either:

      *

        First paragraph (if long and high-scoring), or

      *

        Aggregate the top sentence from top K blocks (K configurable),
        dedupe overlapping content.

Stopword list: include a compact English stoplist. For multi-language
support, detect |lang| attribute or use simple heuristics and select
appropriate stoplist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    11. Markdown conversion rules

  *

    Headings:

      o

        |<h1>| ‚Üí |# |, |<h2>| ‚Üí |## |, etc.

      o

        If a heading appears as a high-score block, promote it to top of
        doc (per scoring).

  *

    Paragraphs: plain text separated by blank line.

  *

    Lists:

      o

        |<ul><li>| ‚Üí |- item|

      o

        |<ol><li>| ‚Üí |1. item| (or keep |-| for simplicity)

  *

    Links:

      o

        Inline convert: |[text](url)|; if link text equals URL, present
        as |<url>| optionally.

      o

        If link target is internal (same host), still include absolute URL.

  *

    Images:

      o

        If block is image with alt and block scored high ‚Üí |![alt text]
        (image_url)|; otherwise list images in metadata.

  *

    Blockquotes: |> quoted text|

  *

    Code/Pre: fenced code block with language if present (best-effort).

  *

    Inline emphasis preserved with |**bold**|, |_italic_|.

  *

    Sentences chosen by summarizer can be wrapped in italics or prefixed
    with |> TL;DR:| optionally (config flag).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    12. Final document assembly (ordering)

  *

    Sort blocks by |Score| descending.

  *

    Option: keep top K blocks (config |--top-k| default 20); optionally
    include all in original order after top-K as "Full article" section.

  *

    Suggested output structure:

     1.

        Optional auto-generated Title (highest scoring |h1|/title)

     2.

        Optional TL;DR paragraph (aggregated)

     3.

        Ranked Blocks (title + 1‚Äì2 sentence summary if |--summarize|
        enabled, then full block text or truncated to |--max-chars-per-
        block|)

     4.

        Separator |---|

     5.

        Full article (original reader-mode content) ‚Äî optional flag |--
        full| to include

     6.

        |---|

     7.

        *Frontmatter / Metadata block* (YAML-like) at *end* (see section 13)

Note: The user's requirement: put frontmatter meta info including
navigation links *at the end*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    13. Frontmatter / metadata block (at end)

  *

    Use YAML or TOML-like block. Example YAML keys:

yaml

Copy code

|---
url: "https://example.com/article"
canonical: "https://example.com/article"
title: "Article Title"
byline: "Author Name"
published: "2024-12-01T08:30:00Z"   # if available, ISO8601
fetched_at: "2025-09-19T11:02:00+02:00"
lang: "en"
top_nav_links:                           # navigation / important links (array)
  - title: "Home"
    url: "https://example.com"
  - title: "Section"
    url: "https://example.com/section"
extracted_links:                         # all links the extractor found (short list)
  - "https://example.com/related-1"
  - "https://external.site/resource"
images:
  - url: "https://example.com/hero.jpg"
    alt: "Hero image"
content_stats:
  blocks_total: 42
  blocks_output: 10
  words_total: 1500
source_host: "example.com"
readability_score_estimate: 1.23         # optional derived metric
notes: "extracted with go-readability; summarizer=statistical"
---
|

  *

    |top_nav_links| selection heuristic:

      o

        From |<nav>| or header links within the same host.

      o

        Filter by visible text length > 2 and not purely icons.

      o

        Prefer links appearing near top of document or in |header| or |
        nav| elements.

      o

        Keep up to N (default 10).

  *

    |extracted_links|:

      o

        De-duplicated list of high-salience links (links appearing
        inside top blocks or images).

      o

        Optionally include |link_text| and |link_context| if helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    14. CLI design & flags

php

Copy code

|Usage: gobrowse [flags] <url>

Flags:
  --top-k int            # number of top blocks to output (default 20)
  --full                 # append the full reader-mode article after ranked blocks
  --summarize bool       # run the statistical summarizer (default true)
  --max-block-chars int  # truncate block text to this many chars in ranked view (default 1000)
  --lang string          # force language (auto-detected if omitted)
  --timeout time         # HTTP timeout (default 10s)
  --no-readability       # skip go-readability and use fallback
  --output file          # write output to file (default stdout)
  --config file          # config file for weights & stopwords
  --include-images       # include images inline if available
  --top-nav N            # number of nav links to include in metadata (default 10)
  --debug                # emit extra debug info to stderr (features, scores)
  --robots-check         # respect robots.txt (default false)
  --user-agent string    # custom UA
|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    15. Configuration & tuning

  *

    Provide a JSON or YAML config file with scoring weights:

yaml

Copy code

|weights:
  tag: {h1:3.0, h2:2.0, h3:1.2, p:1.0, blockquote:1.4}
  length: {short:0.1, medium:1.0, long:0.9}
  position_factor: 0.5
  link_penalty_factor: 2.0
  emphasis_weight: 0.1
summarizer:
  sentences_per_block: 1
  stopwords: "/path/to/stopwords/en.txt"
|

  *

    Expose an endpoint/CLI flag to dump scoring features for debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    16. Testing strategy

  *

    Unit tests:

      o

        Block segmentation tests on sample HTML fragments (headings,
        lists, nested blocks).

      o

        Feature extraction tests (link density, emphasis counts).

      o

        Scoring tests: deterministic output for contrived blocks.

      o

        Markdown conversion idempotence tests (round-trip minimal).

  *

    Integration tests:

      o

        Use a set of canonical webpages (news article, blog, product
        page, forum thread) stored as fixtures (HTML saved locally).

      o

        Verify:

          +

            Top block is article title for article-like pages.

          +

            Navigation links extracted correctly for sites with header nav.

          +

            No nav-only pages accidentally prioritized.

  *

    Performance tests:

      o

        Measure fetch + parse + extract latency for typical pages (aim
        <500ms CPU + network).

  *

    Fuzz tests:

      o

        Malformed HTML, huge pages, many images, heavy JS-inlined content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    17. Edge cases & heuristics to handle them

  *

    *Single-page apps (content rendered by JS):*

      o

        Without headless browser, many SPA pages will be empty. Offer
        |--render-js| switch that calls an external headless renderer
        (optional) ‚Äî note: this violates the no-LLM constraint but is
        allowed as external tool. Mark |--render-js| as opt-in.

  *

    *Multi-article pages (index pages):*

      o

        If |go-readability| produces multiple article-like blocks,
        produce a TOC and output top N article summaries.

  *

    *Paywalls / truncated content:*

      o

        Detect common paywall markers (|subscribe|, |paywall|) and mark
        metadata |paywalled: true|.

  *

    *Very short pages (single paragraph):*

      o

        Output as-is; still include links in metadata.

  *

    *Languages other than English:*

      o

        Attempt |lang| detection from |html[lang]| or meta tag; choose
        stopword set accordingly. If missing, fallback to English stoplist.

  *

    *Duplicate content due to AMP / printer versions:*

      o

        Prefer |canonical| link; if multiple canonical candidates,
        choose final URL's host priority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    18. Security & privacy

  *

    Run fetched HTML/processing in-memory; do not execute scripts.

  *

    Sanitize any HTML that might be re-rendered (use |bluemonday|).

  *

    Avoid following untrusted redirects to file:// or unusual schemes.

  *

    Respect user agent and robots.txt options configurable.

  *

    If writing to disk, sanitize file paths.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    19. Observability & debug output

  *

    |--debug| prints JSON lines (to stderr) with:

      o

        Blocks with final score and key features.

      o

        Chosen top nav links.

      o

        Timing metrics for each stage.

  *

    Provide an option |--dump-blocks-json file| to store full block
    objects for offline analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    20. Example workflow & commands

  *

    Basic:

nginx

Copy code

|gobrowse https://example.com/article > article.md
|

  *

    Top 10 blocks + summarizer off:

nginx

Copy code

|gobrowse --top-k 10 --summarize=false https://example.com/article > gist.md
|

  *

    Include full article afterwards:

nginx

Copy code

|gobrowse --full https://example.com/article > output.md
|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    21. Sample output (toy example)

This is an example of the appearance of the final Markdown output
(ranked blocks first), followed by the metadata frontmatter at the end
(as required). Replace with the real extracted content when running the
tool.

|# How Bees Build Hives

*By Jane Smith ‚Äî Jan 8, 2025*

> Bees are nature's master builders: they construct hexagonal cells from wax and use a sophisticated communication system to organize foraging.

## Hive Structure
Bees construct hexagonal cells from wax. Each cell is built to optimize storage and structural stability, allowing the colony to maximize honey and brood space with minimal material.

## Communication
They use a "waggle dance" ‚Äî a movement pattern that conveys direction and distance to nectar sources. This dance is precise and encodes both angle relative to the sun and distance.

## Materials & Temperature Control
Workers secrete wax and actively regulate internal hive temperature. Wax secretion is energetically expensive; therefore hive architecture balances cost and efficiency.

    22. Implementation roadmap & milestones

 1.

    Project skeleton, CLI parsing, HTTP fetcher, HTML normalization.

 2.

    Integrate |go-readability| for main content extraction; basic HTML-
    >block segmentation via |goquery|.

 3.

    Implement feature extraction & scoring engine with default weights
    and |--debug| dump.

 4.

    Implement simple HTML->Markdown converter for core tags.

 5.

    Implement sentence-ranked summarizer & TL;DR aggregation.

 6.

    Add frontmatter writer with nav link extraction.

 7.

    Write unit & integration tests with fixture pages.

 8.

    Add configuration file support, tuning parameters, and performance
    profiling.

 9.

    Optional: |--render-js| integration using headless Chrome (external
    binary) for SPAs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    23. Metrics to evaluate success

  *

    Precision: Does the top N blocks contain the article's actual main
    points? (manual eval on sample set)

  *

    Recall: Do we avoid dropping important paragraphs?

  *

    Clarity: Human raters prefer gist-first ordering vs original ordering.

  *

    Latency: Median runtime for typical news article should be
    acceptable (<1s excluding network).

  *

    Robustness: Handles diverse sites without panic and produces metadata.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    24. Notes, tradeoffs & future enhancements

  *

    Tradeoffs:

      o

        Deterministic heuristics are faster and predictable but will
        never match an LLM's semantic understanding.

      o

        Using reader-mode libraries shifts complexity but may not
        capture non-article pages well.

  *

    Future:

      o

        Add light topic modeling (LDA or vector-based) for cluster-aware
        ordering (still without LLM).

      o

        Add user feedback loop to tweak weights or pin blocks as
        important for domain adaptation.

      o

        Export as JSON for programmatic consumption, and Markdown for
        human reading.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Done ‚Äî Copyable Markdown

The entire spec above is in Markdown and is intended to be copy-pasted
into your planning docs, issues, or another tool. If you'd like, I can now:

  *

    Produce a minimal Go prototype skeleton (file list + short TODOs), or

  *

    Generate concrete pseudocode for the scoring function and summarizer
    that you can translate into Go.

Which would you prefer next?


          You said:

and finally, come up with a cute name and executable (not too long! but also not an acronym) 


            ChatGPT said:

Here are some name ideas that fit the vibe ‚Äî *short, memorable, and a
little bit playful* ‚Äî while hinting at what your tool does (distills
the /essence/ of a web page for the CLI):

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      üêù Name ideas

Name	Vibe	Notes
*Essence*	sleek, clean	Captures the core of a page. Executable: |essence|
*Sift*	short, sharp	Implies sifting through clutter. Executable: |sift|
*Crux*	minimal, punchy	‚ÄúThe crux‚Äù = the central point. Executable: |crux|
*Gistly*	light, friendly	Emphasizes delivering the gist. Executable: |
gistly|
*Nectar*	thematic (like bees collecting the best)	Fits the ‚Äúextracting
the good part‚Äù metaphor. Executable: |nectar|
*Sapling*	organic, gentle	New growth from the root content. Executable:
|sap|
*Quill*	literary, writerly	For turning the web into clean text.
Executable: |quill|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      ‚ö° My top picks

  *

    *|crux|* ‚Äî extremely short, feels CLI-ish, directly means ‚Äúthe heart
    of the matter‚Äù

  *

    *|sift|* ‚Äî very short, clear metaphor, and sounds fast

  *

    *|nectar|* ‚Äî more playful/metaphorical, pairs well with the idea of
    ‚Äúbees pulling the good part out of the flower‚Äù

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can also check which of these are *available as crates/
homebrew formulae and not widely used as CLI names*, to avoid name
collisions.

Would you like me to do that?


          You said:

can we play on the √ü char somehow? something about essence


            ChatGPT said:

Ah ‚Äî *perfect spark* üí°

Playing on *‚Äúessence‚Äù* and the *German ‚Äú√ü‚Äù (Eszett)* is clever ‚Äî it
visually evokes ‚Äúss‚Äù and gives your tool a distinctive look.

Here are some *name ideas around that theme*:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      üÖ±Ô∏è Names playing on ‚Äú√ü‚Äù and essence

Name	Pronunciation	Concept	Executable
*Eszence*	/Àà…õs.s…õns/	Stylized spelling of /essence/ with |√ü| hidden
inside (s+z)	|eszence|
*E√üence*	/Àà…õs.s…õns/	Looks like /essence/ with √ü	|essence| (ascii executable)
*Essenz*	/Àà…õs.s…õnts/	Actual German word for /essence/	|essenz|
*Konzentrat*	/k…în.tÕ°s…õnÀàt ÅaÀêt/	German for /concentrate/, i.e. distilled
core	|konz|
*Destillat*	/d…õs.tiÀàlaÀêt/	German for /distillate/, i.e. extracted pure
part	|desti|
*S√ºmmar*	/Ààz è.m…ëÀê Å/ (playful)	Fake-German-ified /summary/	|summar|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      üí° Suggestion

The cleanest balance of:

  *

    short and typeable

  *

    cute/unique

  *

    meaningful
    ‚Ä¶is:

    *|essenz|* ‚Äî the actual German word for essence, with that sharp |z|
    hinting at the |√ü|.

It feels like a proper CLI name (|essenz https://‚Ä¶|) and subtly winks at
German while still being pronounceable internationally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can also give you a *tiny ASCII logo / CLI banner* that
uses the |√ü| character for fun.

Want me to do that?


          You said:

yes, I think we should lean in to the √ü being the "brand" and the name being essez


            ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî *|essez|* is an excellent pick ‚úÖ

  *

    It looks like /essence/ + /√ü/ (because |ss| ‚Üí |√ü| ‚Üí |esz|)

  *

    It‚Äôs short, clean, and CLI-friendly

  *

    It‚Äôs memorable and feels a bit mysterious (in a good way)

And visually we can really *lean into |√ü| as the brand glyph*, even
though the executable is spelled |essez| (ASCII-safe).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    üÖ±Ô∏è Branding concept for |essez|

*Name*: |essez|
*Executable*: |essez|
*Mascot glyph / logo element*: |√ü|

*Pronunciation*: like ‚Äúessence‚Äù or ‚Äúess-eh-z‚Äù ‚Äî flexible
*Tagline*: ‚ÄúDistill the web.‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe essence of the web, at your terminal.‚Äù

  *

    Footer frontmatter with navigation metadata

  *

    Optional |--raw| mode to dump text in DOM order

  *

    Optional |--tree| to see the structure/importance ranking

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you like, next I can draft a *tiny brand guide* (colors, tone, logo,
etc.) so it has a distinctive identity while still feeling ‚ÄúUnixy.‚Äù

Want me to do that?
